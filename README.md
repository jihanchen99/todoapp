# Welcome to your To-Do app ðŸ‘‹

This is a simple To-Do app built with React Native. It allows users to manage their daily tasks by adding, completing, and deleting tasks. Completed tasks are moved to a separate "Completed Tasks" section, making it easy to track what's been done and what still needs attention.

## Features

1. **Add Task:** Users can add new tasks to the "Today's Tasks" list.
2. **Mark Task as Complete:** Users can mark tasks as complete by tapping on them. Completed tasks are moved to the "Completed Tasks" section.
3. **Delete Task:** Users can delete tasks from either the "Today's Tasks" or "Completed Tasks" sections by pressing the delete button next to each task.
4. **Task List:** Displays all tasks in a list view, showing both incomplete and completed tasks in separate sections.
